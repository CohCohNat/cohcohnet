                    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My name is <strong><u>Micoh G. Villar</u></strong> , and I was born at Fabella Hospital in Sta. Cruz Manila.<sup>1</sup> Childhood for me was devoid of grandeur; it was a simple existence.<sup>2</sup> Our household was a modest one, comprising my two grandparents, one of my aunties, my parents, and us, their four children.<sup>3</sup> Among us siblings, we shared a unique bond: our names all began with the letter "M." This seemed to be our parents' way of forging a familial identity.<sup>4</sup> Early memories take me back to <strong>Malabon City</strong>, where my grandparents and parents toiled, and where we called home.<sup>5</sup> Despite their hard work, our lifestyle remained humble.<sup>6</sup> Every penny was stretched to meet our basic needs and cover our bills.<sup>7</sup> Yet, amidst financial constraints, education remained a priority.<sup>8</sup> I commenced my schooling at <strong>Malabon Elementary School</strong>, encountering hardships from the outset.<sup>9</sup> Bullied and unfairly reprimanded by teachers, I endured a traumatic phase, dreading the school's gates each morning.<sup>10</sup> Eventually, the strain became too much, prompting my parents to halt my studies temporarily.<sup>11</sup> Months later, tragedy struck as Typhoon Ondoy ravaged our home, forcing us to relocate to <strong>Cainta, Rizal</strong>.<sup>12</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>My parents enrolled me at <strong>Cainta Elementary School</strong> where I found the opportunity for a fresh start.<sup>13</sup> Despite initial trepidation, I gradually found my footing, forming friendships that supported my academic journey.<sup>14</sup> Soon, I emerged as one of the top performers in grades one and two.<sup>15</sup> However, life's unpredictability soon intervened.<sup>16</sup> Financial hardships compounded by my father's departure necessitated another move, this time to Pasig.<sup>17</sup> Once again, I found myself in unfamiliar territory, adjusting to a new school and surroundings.<sup>18</sup> Yet, armed with the resilience and determination cultivated during my early years, I navigated the challenges of elementary education with newfound confidence.<sup>19</sup> With each hurdle overcome, I forged new friendships, absorbed fresh knowledge, and amassed experiences that would shape the trajectory of my future endeavors.<sup>20</sup><br><br></p>

                    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>High school, for me, was an unforgettable chapter in my life, one filled with numerous experiences and achievements.<sup>1</sup> I embarked on this educational journey at <strong>Manuel I. Santos Memorial National High School</strong>, now known as Manuel I. Santos Integrated School, situated in <strong>Taytay, Rizal</strong>.<sup>2</sup> Securing a spot in this institution after successfully passing the entrance examination was a significant milestone.<sup>3</sup> Moreover, I was placed in the first pilot section, a testament to my academic prowess.<sup>4</sup> Transitioning into this new environment posed no challenge for me, given my prior experiences of switching schools.<sup>5</sup> I adapted quickly, seamlessly integrating into the competitive atmosphere.<sup>6</sup> Despite the intensity of academic competition, I remained committed to excelling and maintaining harmonious relationships with my peers.<sup>7</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>Throughout my high school tenure, I consistently demonstrated academic excellence, earning the distinction of being an <strong>honor student</strong> from start to finish.<sup>8</sup> This achievement was a culmination of my dedication to my studies, camaraderie with classmates, and active participation in extracurricular activities.<sup>9</sup> Among the cherished memories of my high school years is my involvement in the <em>"Science Investigatory Project"</em> team during grade 9.<sup>10</sup> Leveraging my previous experiences from elementary school, I showcased my skills and competed at the Division Level, securing <strong><em>2<sup style="color: #4D4D4D;">nd</sup> place</em></strong> in the Life Science individual category.<sup>11</sup><br><br></p>
            
                    <p>My journey with the Science Investigatory Project continued into grade 10, presenting me with another opportunity to represent our school.<sup>12</sup> Despite rigorous preparation and additional experiments based on judges' feedback, I fell short and attained <strong><em>4<sup style="color: #4D4D4D;">th</sup>place</em></strong>.<sup>13</sup> Nonetheless, that experience served as a valuable learning opportunity and contributed to my personal growth.<sup>14</sup> Furthermore, it provided me with the chance to publish my study in the <b>Ascendans Asia Journal of Multidisciplinary Research Abstracts</b>, a testament to the quality of my research.<sup>15</sup><br><br></p>
            
                    <p>Simultaneously, I held the position of <strong>Vice President</strong> in our <em>Supreme Student Government</em>, collaborating with fellow leaders to organize various school activities and address student concerns.<sup>16</sup> Additionally, I took on the role of <strong>Public Information Officer</strong> for the <em>Taytay SSG Federation</em>, extending my service to the larger Taytay community.<sup>17</sup> These leadership roles allowed me to make a meaningful impact and hone my skills in governance and public relations.<sup>18</sup><br><br></p>
                
                    <p>Reflecting on my accomplishments in high school fills me with a sense of fulfillment and anticipation for the future.<sup>19</sup> As I prepare to embark on the next chapter of my journey, I carry with me the lessons learned and memories forged during these formative years.<sup>20</sup><br><br></p>

                    <h2>College Years</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A</b></mark>midst the finality of my high school years, the unexpected upheaval of the pandemic swept through, altering our educational landscape dramatically.<sup>1</sup> Suddenly, everything transitioned to the digital realm, including our much-anticipated graduation ceremony.<sup>2</sup> My well-laid plans were disrupted as I grappled with the decision of whether to pursue further studies or not, a choice made all the more challenging by the uncertainty of the times.<sup>3</sup> Fortunately, <strong>Jose Rizal University</strong> offered late enrollment options, affording me the opportunity to continue my education.<sup>4</sup> Senior high school unfolded predominantly in virtual classrooms, marking a period characterized by a blend of admiration and frustration towards online learning.<sup>5</sup> Time seemed to slip away unnoticed, culminating in the unexpected arrival of graduation day, where farewells were bid to classmates without the customary shared experiences of traditional schooling.<sup>6</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>Despite the unconventional circumstances, I persevered, gaining invaluable insights into what awaited me in college.<sup>7</sup> While senior high school lacked the traditional classroom dynamics, it served as a pivotal stepping stone toward my academic journey.<sup>8</sup> Setting my sights on <strong>University of the East</strong> for college, I followed in the footsteps of my sisters and honored my father's collegiate alma mater, despite his unfinished tenure.<sup>9</sup> The transition to UE proved to be a positive change, offering a more organized environment and streamlined processes.<sup>10</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>Embarking on my freshman year at UE filled me with excitement and anticipation.<sup>11</sup> Delving into the realm of <strong><em>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</em></strong>, I found myself immersed in a world of new concepts and ideas.<sup>12</sup> Forming connections with like-minded peers enriched my collegiate experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared passion for learning.<sup>13</sup> Each subject, whether minor or major, offered unique insights, shaped by the expertise and teaching styles of our professors.<sup>14</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>Throughout my freshman year, I delved into various programming languages, including <strong><u>Python</u></strong>, <strong><u>Java</u></strong>, <strong><u>C#</u></strong>, and <strong><u>R</u></strong> Languages, under the guidance of knowledgeable instructors.<sup>15</sup> Their dedication to imparting knowledge fueled my curiosity and expanded my skill set exponentially.<sup>16</sup> Additionally, I assumed the role of <strong>Executive Vice-President for E-sports</strong> within <em>COMSSO</em>, collaborating with a dynamic team of individuals and contributing to the vibrant campus community.<sup>17</sup><br><br></p>

                    <p>Now embarking on my second semester of sophomore year, I recognize the boundless opportunities for growth and learning that lie ahead.<sup>18</sup> As I strive to cultivate my skills and carve a path in the field of IT, I eagerly anticipate the challenges and discoveries awaiting me in the coming years.<sup>19</sup> With a steadfast commitment to personal and academic development, I am poised to embrace the journey ahead with enthusiasm and determination.<sup>20</sup><br><br></p>
